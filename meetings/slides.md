  <p>the most important skill in any group activity</p>

## Overview

-   Most people are really bad at meetings
    -   Because they've never been taught how
-   A core skill for anyone who wants change
    -   And can help you steer other people's meetings…
-   You don't have to invent this yourself

## Do We Need a Meeting?

-   To review and give feedback? No—do it asynchronously
-   To inform? Only if you are expecting deep questions
-   To consult? Only if people get a veto
    -   Otherwise it's just informing with pretense
-   To make decisions when asynchronous review can't
    -   But only in small groups
    -   Or with well-defined procedural rules

## A Theory

> Meetings have proliferated because they're easier to do
> (you don't even have to get out of your chair)
> and because they have become a substitute for casual social interaction.

## Create an Agenda

-   If you don't care enough to make a list, you don't need a meeting
-   Include timings
-   Prioritize
-   Plan to end early

> The fundamental unit of time is the bladder.

## Have Clear Rules for Making Decisions

-   (And for knowing what decisions have been made)
-   "The Tyranny of Structurelessness" (Jo Freeman)
    -   Every group has a power structure
    -   The only question is whether it's explicit and accountable
    -   Or implicit and unaccountable
-   If you need Robert's Rules of Order, you need training

## Martha's Rules

1.  Proposal with sponsor
    -   A day before the meeting (no sandbagging)
2.  Sense vote (+1, 0, -1)
    -   If no one objects, proposal passes
3.  Discussion as needed
4.  Binding vote (+1 or -1 only)

## Have a Moderator

-   Moderators should not do all the talking
    -   Any more than conductors play all the notes
-   Call on specific people in order
-   Allow them one point at a time
-   Keep a backlog

</section>

## Require Politeness

-   All the other rules are special cases of this…
-   No technology during in-person meeting
    -   Except for assistive technology or family need
    -   "Please put your devices in politeness mode"
-   No interruptions
    -   Except by moderator
-   No rambling

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

## What to Talk About

-   Progress, plans, and problems go up
-   Context and priorities come down

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

## Record Minutes

-   So people who weren't there know what happened
-   So people who were there agree what happened
-   So people can be held accountable at later meetings

## Manage "That Guy"

-   This is the moderator's other job
    -   <https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/>
-   Three stickies
-   Interruption bingo

## Be an Active Participant

-   Decline invitations
-   Read the agenda and material before the meeting
-   Take your own notes
-   Use participants' names
-   Use definite nouns
-   Pause before speaking
-   Put down your hand

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

## Life Online

-   Do not record the meeting without willing consent
-   No mixed-mode meetings: all in person or all online
-   Review meeting protocol at the start
-   Take minutes in a shared document
-   Raise hands digitally

> I'll Slack you a link to the Google sheet
> that will tell you which GitHub repo's wiki
> we're using to track mailing lists.

## Seek Truth, Not Victory

-   Don't raise points you don't actually believe in
    -   The devil doesn't need more advocates
-   No social dominance displays
    -   "Well actually…"
-   Don't make excuses for your questions or opinions
    -   "This is probably stupid, but…"
