<h1>Software Engineering: Tools, Process, Evidence, and Responsibility</h1>
<ul>
<li>A one-semester introduction to software engineering for junior and senior undergraduates<ul>
<li>Three classroom hours per week for 12 weeks</li>
<li>Mix of individual and collaborative assessments</li>
<li><em>Not</em> trying to emulate product development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assume learners can already:<ul>
<li>Use the Unix command line</li>
<li>Diff, commit, push, pull, and merge with Git</li>
<li>Write Python programs that are hundreds of lines long</li>
<li>Write JavaScript programs that are dozens of lines long</li>
<li>Write unit tests in both languages</li>
<li>Write an inner join in SQL</li>
<li>Use breakpoints in a symbolic debugger</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Four themes:<ol>
<li>Tools:
    linters, profilers, fuzz testers, static analyzers,
    and others that they won't have seen in earlier courses</li>
<li>Process:
    effective meetings,
    gathering and tracking requirements,
    issue triage,
    incident management,
    and other activities that arise in programming in the large</li>
<li>Evidence:
    how to do empirical studies,
    how to tell good ones from bad ones,
    key results,
    and open questions</li>
<li>Responsibility:
    how programmers can help and harm each other,
    how software companies have harmed society,
    and how to prevent, mitigate, or remediate those harms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learner Persona</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shae, 20, is in the third year of an undergraduate degree in computer science.
    They didn't get much out of their high school programming class,
    but enjoyed the robotics club.</li>
<li>Shae is comfortable with object-oriented programming in Python,
    and did well in their introductory courses on databases and web programming last semester.
    They like working on homework assignments with friends,
    but had a bad experience in the team project in the web programming class.
    They program in VS Code,
    but still use print statements more than the debugger.</li>
<li>Shae found their first internship last summer exciting
    because they got to work on real problems,
    but bewildering because they felt they spent more time in meetings
    than they did doing "real" work.
    They also heard senior programmers arguing about whether AI is a boon or a curse,
    and would like to know how to answer questions like that.</li>
<li>Shae is impatient with abstract theory;
    they learn best when generalizing from practical examples.</li>
