  <h1>Performance Reviews</h1>
  <p>a manager's most important responsibility</p>
</header>

<section class="slide" id="cover" markdown="1">

## Overview

-   You can't get better if you don't know how you're doing
-   But reviews are frightening because so much depends on them
    -   "Not if you have a culture of trust" is a bullshit response
-   Show how *not* to do them
-   Always look at:
    -   Past performance: how has the subject done recently?
    -   Future growth: what are reasonable expectations?

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

## Self-Assessment

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Accomplishments

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

Looking back on the previous performance period,
what accomplishments or successes are you most proud of?
Why?
What were the most significant challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?*

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Accomplishments

> I met all my targets.

Targets can change significantly over 6 months,
so listing a few specific examples helps you and your manager focus on specifics.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Accomplishments

> I didn't murder Bob when he spilled coffee on my keyboard.

Laudable,
but humor and dramatic exaggeration don't belong in your HR records.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Accomplishments

> I managed to finish a data analysis in time for the board presentation
> even though Bob got me the data later than he promised he would.

Commentary on Bob's performance belongs in his peer feedback section,
not in your self-assessment.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Effectiveness

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

How effectively did you meet the goals and objectives set for you during the past performance period?
Provide specific examples.
What helped/hindered you in that process?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Effectiveness

> I didn't meet any of my goals—I suck at this job and you should fire me.

If you didn't meet any of your targets,
they were probably unrealistic and
your manager should have noticed and stepped in before this review.
Pointing out what stopped you from meeting them helps the company do better next time.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Effectiveness

> I wrote 2718 lines of Python.

That's remarkably specific,
but not helpful unless you and your manager agreed at your previous review that
those narrow numerical targets would be the sole basis of your evaluation.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

What are 2-3 key strengths and how are you utilizing them in your role?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

> I'm a good listener.

Too vague: what does this mean in practice,
how would an external observer know you were doing it (or not),
and how does this relate to your role?

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

> I wrote 2718 lines of Python.

That isn't a strength:
it is evidence to support a claim that you have a particular strength.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Teamwork

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

How would team members describe working with you?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Teamwork

> I don't know—you'd have to ask them.

Most of us are uncomfortable praising ourselves,
so it's tempting to dodge questions like these.
However,
comparing how you perceive yourself
with how your colleagues and your managers perceive you
is essential to calibrating your future self-assessments.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

What new skills or knowledge do you want to acquire or develop to enhance your performance?
How do they align with the company's objectives?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> I want to learn how to frobulate bijective queries in Norm.

Setting aside the fact that this response is made-up word salad,
is this goal the right size?
If you do performance reviews every 6 months,
a good goal is one that will take 12 months to achieve.
(so that you can check in and make corrections at the half-way mark).

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> I want to learn how to frobulate bijective queries in Norm.

In addition,
how does this help you progress in your career,
and how does it help the company?
You and your manager might both believe the answers are obvious,
but still be surprised to discover that you disagree on what the "obvious" answer is.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> I'd like to become a product manager.

Wouldn't we all?
Changes of direction are definitely something you should talk about
with your manager and HR,
but this review is for discussing how you're doing in your current role.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Challenges

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

What do you see as your team's biggest challenge in the next six months?
How are you preparing for it?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Challenges

> I don't know how to frobulate bijective queries in Norm.

Again with the word salad…
But if it is a reasonable response,
it is missing the point,
which is for you to think one level higher than your personal performance.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Challenges

> I don't know how to frobulate bijective queries in Norm.

What could go wrong for your team in the next six months?
Do you think you'll be short-staffed?
Required to solve problems you're not trained to solve?
Are you worried about morale or last-minute requests for impossible amounts of work?
And what could you, your team, and your manager do now to prevent or get ready for those things?

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Challenges

> Bob keeps spilling coffee on my keyboard
> and if it happens again I'm going to lose it.

This is actually a reasonable response.
Tensions within a team will affect its performance;
most of us are less comfortable talking about them,
but if your manager doesn't know there's a problem,
they can't try to fix it.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Support

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

How can your manager best support you?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Support

> Just tell me how many functions I'm supposed to write this quarter.

This isn't necessarily a bad response:
setting clear goals is one of the most supportive things a manager can do.
However,
it's very shallow.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Support

> Give me $3000 so I can go to conference X.

Your manager probably doesn't have the authority to do this.
That doesn't mean it isn't worth bringing up:
if enough people ask for a specific change like this,
it will prompt your employer to take another look at its policies.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

## Manager Assessment

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

What 2-3 strengths did you see this person exhibit in this performance period?
Give examples of how these strengths had a positive impact on the team, department, or company.

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

> They met all their targets.

-   Too vague to be useful.
-   We expect this because we expect managers to set reasonable targets.
-   What impact did this have on the team?

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

> They demonstrated empathy [example],
> resilience [example],
> honesty [example],
> perseverance [example],
> and intelligence [example].

The question asks for 2–3 rather than a shopping list of laudatory adjectives
because we want to know what this person was particularly good at.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

> They were much better at meeting their deadlines than Bob.

this exercise is about *this* person:
feedback on Bob should go in Bob's feedback form.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Challenges

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

Were there any specific challenges or areas where this person faced difficulties?
How did they handle those situations?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Challenges

> They have trouble communicating clearly with me.

Are you sure the fault is entirely on their side?
Saying, "We have trouble communicating,"
would be a better starting point for a discussion.
(And if the problem is communication,
someone from HR could sit in as moderator and help you both.)

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Challenges

> They kept falling behind in their assigned tasks.

-   A couple of examples will help focus discussion.
-   If you have a theory about why this happens,
    putting it in the form will also help discussion about the underlying cause.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Effectiveness

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

How effectively did this person meet the goals and objectives
set during the previous performance period?
Provide specific examples of their achievements.

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Effectiveness

> They did outstanding work. Really.

Please provide 2–3 examples:
even small ones reassure people that you've actually thought about their performance in particular
and aren't plastering the same vague pleasantries into everyone's form.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Improvement

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

In what areas do you think this person has shown the most improvement
since the last review?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Improvement

> They were supposed to learn how to frobulate bijective queries in Norm.

That's not an example of growth or improvement—please focus on the positives in this section.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Improvement

> They're much better at hiding their annoyance
> when Bob runs over time in the meeting room they have booked for a call.

This isn't something they should have to get better at.
If you are giving feedback like this to them,
it is your responsibility as a manager to take steps
to make sure they don't have to keep doing it.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

What could this person do differently to be more impactful in the future?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> They should talk to Bob about how they get on each other's nerves.

No: *you* should talk to them and Bob, both individually and together,
to iron this out:
that's a core responsibility of being a manager.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> They should talk to Bob about how they get on each other's nerves.

When you do this,
you should not just split the difference between their positions,
because that rewards the person who is being more extreme or unreasonable.
Being a manager sometimes means deciding that
one person is in the right and one is in the wrong
and acting accordingly.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> They should learn how to frobulate bijective queries in Norm.

But this was one of their goals in the last round,
so what should they do differently in this round to make it happen?
"Try again" isn't a particularly useful answer—you should suggest specific changes
and be clear about what you are going to do differently this time
to help them achieve that goal.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: New Areas

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

Are there any specific areas where the employee can take on new responsibilities
to further their professional development?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: New Areas

> They should run a half-day workshop on frobulating bijectives queries in Norm.

Great!
But is this on top of their existing responsibilities?
If so, does it mean you're asking them to work even longer hours?
Or have you (and they) identified something they can de-prioritize
or stop doing entirely in order to make time for this?

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: New Areas

> They should mentor an intern.

Great!
Has budget for an internship been approved?
Because it would suck to dangle this in front of them and then say,
"You can't actually have it."

### Looking Back: Strengths

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

> They didn't complain when I ran overtime in the meeting room.

On the one hand, yes, being the better person is a strength.
On the other hand, you shouldn't require your colleagues to work around you.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Strengths

> They helped me find a tailor who could alter a suit for me on short notice.

This isn't a bad answer:
we all have lives outside of work,
and helping people with things that might otherwise be distractions
is useful as well as kind.
But if you include something like this,
please only include one such point:
we want to focus on things that happen here at work.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Collaboration

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

Describe how the employee communicates and collaborates with colleagues
across different projects or departments.

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Collaboration

> They don't, really.

It's OK to say this if it's true:
some of us really do work solely with our immediate teammates.
However, that's actually pretty rare—if you believe it of someone,
the odds are that they are interacting with people,
just at times and in places that you don't see,
so please check.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Back: Collaboration

> They spend too much/not enough time talking with [person or team].

You may be right, but "a lot" and "a little" aren't the same as "too much" or "not enough".
What do you base your expectation on?

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

<blockquote class="question" markdown="1">

If you could give this person one piece of constructive advice
to make them more effective in their role,
what would you say?
How would this change impact their work?

</blockquote>

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> We all had to learn to put up with Bob—they should too.

No.
There are things we just have to put up with, but truculent colleagues aren't on the list.
Advice on how to escalate or address the issue
(e.g., "schedule a session with HR to figure out a strategy")
is fair game;
defeatism is not.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> They should speak up more in meetings.

This might be reasonable advice,
but be careful about tone policing:
some people are just quieter than others.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Looking Forward: Professional Development

> They should talk less in meetings.

See the above.
On the other hand,
if someone constantly interrupts or always makes three points
when everyone else in the meeting makes one at a time,
they may not be aware of it.
HR can help you find ways to phrase this diplomatically.

This only belongs here if you have written the same thing
(less harshly, with specifics)
in the portion of the form that the employee can see.

</section>

<section class="slide" markdown="1">

### Manager Only

> They are having a lot of conflict with Bob.

This does belong here,
but *your* manager and HR will require more specifics.
It's OK to ask HR how much detail is appropriate before filing the form.
